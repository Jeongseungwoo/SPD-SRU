This is the code for the paper Statistical Recurrent Models on Manifold valued Data.

This is part of the experiment on the UCF11 dataset.

You can find the UCF11 dataset from http://crcv.ucf.edu/data/UCF_YouTube_Action.php, its own website.

When running the codes, be sure that run Preprocessed_UCF11.py first.

Then run the UCF11_cnn_rnn_for_matrix_batch.py.
